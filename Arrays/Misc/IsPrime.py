====================
Problem Description
===================
Given an integer A, you have to tell whether it is a prime number or not.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 which is divisible only by 1 and itself.

====================
Problem Constraints
====================
1 <= A <= 106

====================
Input Format
====================
First and only line of the input contains a single integer A.

====================
Output Format
====================
Print YES if A is a prime, else print NO.

====================
Example Input
====================
Input 1: 3
Input 2: 4

====================
Example Output
====================
Output 1: YES
Output 2: NO

====================
Example Explanation
====================
Explanation 1: 3 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and 3.
Explanation 2: 4 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
